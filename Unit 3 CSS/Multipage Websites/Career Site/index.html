    <h1>Being a Lawyer: Fighting for Justice</h1>
    <h2>Industry: Civil and Political Rights</h2>
    <p>I am interested in a career as a Lawyer because I am especially passionate about people's rights and getting the justice they deserve while also having my mother as a paralegal and aunts and uncles as lawyers. I've always been attatched to the idea of following in my family's footsteps.</p>
