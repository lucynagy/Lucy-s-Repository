            <h2>Chapter 2: Impact of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Environmental impact from human-induced climate change is causing huge disruptions to global weather patterns and ecosystems, endangering all life forms on Earth. Rising temperatures are leading to more frequent heat waves and wildfires, worsening heat-related illnesses and making challenges to daily activities. Also, shifts in rainfall patterns are intensifying storms, causing widespread flooding, landslides, and economic damage. Water scarcity is increasing due to droughts, expanding deserts, and threatening agricultural productivity, increasing food insecurity and poverty worldwide.</p>
