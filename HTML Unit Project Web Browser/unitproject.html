        <h2>Understanding Browsers</h2>
        <h3>Introduction to Browsers</h3>
        <p>A web browser is a software application used to access and view information on the internet. It interprets HTML documents and displays them as many media web pages.</p>
        <p>Web browsers play an important role in allowing users to navigate the World Wide Web by fetching, presenting, and traversing information resources.</p>
        <p>The evolution of browsers has significantly impacted internet usage, enhancing speed, security, and compatibility with web standards.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>How a Browser Works</h2>
        <p>When accessing a webpage, a browser gets the HTML content from a web server, explains the code to provide the page, and displays it on the user's device.</p>
        <p>Web standards make sure a consistent browsing experience by defining how web pages are structured and displayed across different browsers.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Concerns and Solutions</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored by websites in a user's browser. They can track user behavior and preferences.</p>
        <p>Third-party cookies raise privacy concerns as they are used by advertisers to track users across different websites.</p>
        <p>Browsers offer features like private browsing (incognito mode) and tracking prevention to reduce privacy risks.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Webpage Rendering</h2>
        <p>A browser collects data from a webpage by sending requests to the server using URLs. It uses HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>
        <p>Hyperlinks (anchors `<a>` tags) are used to navigate between pages within a website or to external resources.</p>
