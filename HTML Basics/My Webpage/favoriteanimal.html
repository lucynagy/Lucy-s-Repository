        <h2>Life Cycle of the Polar Bear</h2>
        <p>Male polar bears search for female mates on sea ice from April to late June, using scented trails. Mating occurs on the sea ice, but fertilized eggs do not implant until fall, dependent upon the female's fat reserves for sustaining herself and her cubs during denning. This delayed implantation process ensures survival. After mating, adult males stay with the female briefly before separating.</p>

        <p>After feeding extensively during the summer and fall to maximize their weight gain, pregnant female polar bears begin preparing for maternity by constructing dens where they will give birth to their cubs.</p>
        <p>To create a den, the female excavates a small snow cave within a snowdrift, ensuring it is spacious enough for her to maneuver comfortably. She then waits for the entrance tunnel to be covered by snow, concealing the den completely.</p>

        <h2> Their Behavior</h2>
        <p>Polar bears interact with each other using body language, vocalizations, and scent markings. These are just a few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Head wagging from side to side:</strong> An indication that polar bears are engaging in play is when adult bears initiate what appears to be ritualized fighting or mock battling. They do this by standing on their hind legs, with their chin lowered to their chests, and their front paws hanging by their sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Nose-to-nose greeting:</strong> How a bear requests something from another bear, such as food. The visiting bear will approach slowly, circle around a carcass, and timidly touch the feeding bear's nose.</li>
            <li><strong>Rushing:</strong> When a male approaches a female with cubs, she charges towards him with her head lowered.</li>
            <li><strong>Chuffing:</strong> A vocal reaction to stress, commonly observed when a mother bear is concerned about the safety of her cubs.</li>
            <li><strong>Loud roars or growls:</strong> Expresses anger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Their Diet & Prey</h2>
        <p> Polar bears have adapted to hunt ringed and bearded seals, catching them from sea ice platforms. They rely on the rich fat content seals offer but will consume other prey when it's accessible.</p>
        <p>During fall, seals create 10 to 15 breathing holes in the ice using their fore flippers. These holes remain open throughout the winter, even in ice up to 2 meters thick, allowing seals to surface every 5 to 15 minutes. Polar bears hunt by locating seals at these openings using their sense of smell, exhibiting patience during potentially long waits of hours or days. </p>
        <p>Spring is the feasting season for polar bears, marked by the birth of seal pups on the sea ice, which become easy prey. During this time, polar bears consume abundant calories to build up their fat reserves for future lean periods. </p>
        <p>Polar bears primarily prey on seals but will sometimes consume geese, bird eggs, beached whales, and small mammals; however, these foods are less reliable and generally insufficient to sustain the polar bear population due to their calorie content and nutritional value.</p>
