    <h1>My Christmas Break</h1>
    
    <h3>Festive Preparations</h3>
    <p>This Christmas, I started my break by decorating the house and a tree with ornaments. I also spent hours wrapping presents for my family.</p>
    
    <h3>Family Gatherings</h3>
    <p>On Christmas Eve, my family gathered for dinner. We enjoyed a meal together, sharing stories and memories.</p>
    
    <p>Christmas Day was filled with fun as we exchanged gifts and spent quality time together. We played games, watched movies, and made cookies and hot chocolate.</p>
